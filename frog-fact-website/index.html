Their biodiversity is rapidly declining in the Amazon Rainforest as a result of habitat loss and they need your help.</p>

            <h2>Tree Frogs and Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Tree frogs are found on every continent except Antarctica, but they’re most diverse in the tropics of the western hemisphere. Amphibians are declining worldwide and are collectively one of the most at-risk groups for extinction. They breathe through their skin, which makes them especially sensitive to environmental change. This means that tree frogs are important indicators to environmental changes and are very valuable in environmental studies.  We should help the little guys, as they help us.</p>

                lost over 80% of its population in Panama during the past 10 years. Like many endangered frogs, an infectious fungal
                disease called chytridiomycosis has led to the decline. The fungus has infected amphibians in many parts of the globe,
                including North and South America, the Caribbean, and Australia.</p>

                under threat from a landslide. The range of this frog once stretched across Costa Rica to Panama. The exact reasons for
                this species’ decline are unknown, but habitat loss and chytridiomycosis present two possible theories. These frogs are
                found along streams and are active during the day.</p>

                <p class="description">Glass frogs live in and among the trees and plants of humid mountain forests in Central and South America. Higher up the
                mountain the rainforests are called cloud forests because the trees are almost always covered in clouds. Glass frogs are
                mostly active at night, which makes them very difficult to spot for predators.</p>

                <h3 class="frog-name">Blue Poison Dart Frog</h3>
                <p class="description">The blue poison dart frog or blue poison arrow frog (Dendrobates tinctorius "azureus") is a poison dart frog found in
                the forests surrounded by the Sipaliwini Savanna, which is located in southern Suriname and adjacent far northern
                Brazil. D. tinctorius azureus is also known by its indigenous Tirio name, okopipi. These frogs spend most of their awake
                time, during the day, hopping around in short leaps. Although poison dart frogs are known for their skin toxins, used on
                the tips of arrows or darts of natives, in reality only the species of the genus Phyllobates are used in this manner. In
                captivity, the frogs lose toxicity as a result of altered diets.</p>

                <p class="description">The Ctenophryne carpish was a rare species discovered in 2002.  They are endemic to Peru and holds a status of endangered.  The Ctenophryne carpish lives in cloud forest environments where there is more moisture in the air.  They use bromeliads as breeding grounds and their diets consist of arthropods.  Their decline in population is likely due to habitat destruction and agricultural expansion.</p>

The spiny-headed tree frog sets itself apart from others with its unique male call. The male individuals of the species have a call that sounds similar to “boop...boop...boop”.  They can be found in lowland rainforests and high elevation humid forests.  The spiny-headed tree frog is threatened by habitat disturbances such as deforestation. </p>
